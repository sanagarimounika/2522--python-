# Student Grade Tracker 
# Variables, Operators, Conditionals, Loops  

-> Create an Python Application that tracks students grades 
for multiple subjects 

-> Collect following info from student 

    -> Student ID
    -> Student Name
    -> Attendance 
    -> Scores 

-> Scores 

    -> Repeatedly ask student to enter scores (0-100)

        -> yes for continue 
        -> no to continue 

    -> Calculate Average Score 

    -> Determine Performance based on Average Score 

        -> 85 and above -> "A Grade"
        -> 70 to 84 -> "B Grade"
        -> 50 to 69 -> "C Grade"
        -> Below 50 -> "D Grade"

    -> Check Attendance 

        -> Ask Attendance (1-100) % 
        -> 75 and above, display "OK - GOOD ATTENDANCE"
        -> Below 75  "WARNING - LOW ATTENDANCE"

    -> Display Final Results 

        -> Student ID
        -> Student Name 
        -> Total Score 
        -> Average Score 
        -> Performance Level 
        -> Attendance Status 

-> Application Simulation

   Enter Your ID: 
   Enter Your Name: 
   Enter Score For Subject 1: 85
   Do you want to enter with another score ? (yes/no) yes 
   Enter Score For Subject 2: 90
   Do you want to enter with another score ? (yes/no) no 
   // start working with logics
