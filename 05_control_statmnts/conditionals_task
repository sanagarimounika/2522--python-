# Get user input for the following information:
    Student's name 
    Student's grade level (1-12) 
    Base tuition fee 
    Academic toppers

Implement input validation using conditional statements
    Check if grade is between 1-12

    For students in grades 9 to 12:
        If they are academic toppers, apply a 20% discount.
        Otherwise, apply a 10% discount.
